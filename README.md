</h3>
Interactive graphical tool for batch image scaling built with OpenCV and CustomTkinter. Allows directory selection for input/output folders and resizing parameters through a modern GUI. Implements automated processing of common image formats (.jpg, .png, .bmp, .tiff) with real-time feedback and exception handling. Supports dark-themed adaptive UI design using Orbitron typography and dynamic color palette (purple-red-yellow scheme). Designed for pre-processing of visual datasets prior to training or deployment in computer vision pipelines.
